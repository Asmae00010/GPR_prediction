# GPR_prediction

This project develops an predictive model utilizing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to estimate machining constraints and deformations.

By inputting key parameters such as cutting speed and depth, the model simplifies complex usinage simulations that traditionally take hours to compute. 

The application of GPR enables accurate predictions with reduced computational overhead, significantly enhancing efficiency in machining process planning and optimization.
